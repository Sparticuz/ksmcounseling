In the playroom, your child is free to do what kids do best: play! The playroom is full of fun and intentionally
selected toys to help your child heal and grow. As your child plays, I will verbally reflect their activity and
feelings, building their self-awareness and sense of self-worth. As your child internalizes my verbal cues, your child
will feel encouraged to face the challenges in their life.
