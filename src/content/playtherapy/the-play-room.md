In the play room your child is free to do what kids do best: play! The playroom is full of fun and intentionally
selected toys to help your child heal and grow. In Child-Centered Play Therapy, I do not direct your childâ€™s play, so
that your child is free to make choices and explore. I build a safe and trusting relationship with your child that
encourages your child to process tough emotions, try new behaviors, and discover their inner strengths, all through
their play. As your child plays, I will verbally reflect their activity and feelings, building their self-awareness and
sense of self-worth. As your child internalizes my verbal cues, your child will feel encouraged to face the challenges
in their life.
