A child’s most natural activity is to play. With Child-Centered Play Therapy, children express their feelings, learn
new skills, grow, and heal. In the playroom, your child will build confidence, responsibility, self-control,
self-acceptance, and coping skills. In Child-Centered Play Therapy, I do not direct your child’s play, so
that your child is free to make choices and explore. I build a safe and trusting relationship with your child that
encourages your child to process tough emotions, try new behaviors, and discover their inner strengths all through
their play.
