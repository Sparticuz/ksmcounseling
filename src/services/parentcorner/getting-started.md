You are the first person I will meet as we start this journey! During the Free Parent Consultation, I want to give you
my undivided attention and help you to feel free to discuss anything that you find relevant without your child present.
I will further explain my approach to play therapy and answer all of your questions. Once you are ready to move forward,
 we will schedule your childâ€™s first session.
